### Previous Experience (XP)
Anything with "XP:" is targeted at people who are familiar with other languages to highlight things which are different about Lua. To start there is no semi-colons to end a line, instead a new line is often used to signify a new line of code. Also Lua is a dynamically typed language which means that variables are not fixed to a specific type.

### Hello World
This will print a message into the console
```lua
print("Hello World")
```
<br>
### Variables
Variables are defined with the "local" keyword. They allow you to store a value such as a number, string, boolean, etc.
```lua
local x = 10
local name = "john doe"
local isAlive = false
```
<br>
Number operators:  
* \+ addition
* \- minus
* \* multiply
* / divide
* ^ power
* % modulus

XP: i++ and i-- operators don't exist for numbers in Lua
```lua
--adding 1 to x
local x = 10
print(x + 1) --result: 11
print(x * 2) --result: 20
print(x / 2) --result: 5
```
<br>
String concatenation uses the .. operator

XP: Lua doesn't use + to concatenate strings
```lua
local phrase = "My name is "
local name = "John Doe"
print(phase .. name) --result: My name is John Doe
```

One of the most useful variable type is the table. Multiple values together and access them with a key.
```lua
local info = {
  name = "John",
  age = 18
}
print(info.name .. ": " .. tostring(info.age)) --result: John: 18

--this syntax is also valid
print(info["name"] .. ": " .. tostring(info["age"])) --result: John: 18
```
<br>
XP: Arrays don't exist in Lua, instead you have indexed arrays. By default Lua starts counting from one and not zero.
```lua
local materials = {
  "concrete",
  "wood",
  "metal"
}
print(materials[1]) --result: concrete
```

Global variables can be access from everywhere
```lua
local _G.foo = 10
```
<br>
### Comments
Comments won't be executed and can explain what a block of code does in English. This will allow you and others to understand your better. Everything after "--" will be commented out, but only on that line. You can comment out a block of code using "--[[ ]]"
```lua
local x = 10 --this is a number
local y = "10" --this is a string
local isAlive = false --this is a boolean

--x=11 (this doesn't execute)

--[[
Everything in here is a commented out
x=11 (this doesn't execute)

I don't execute either
]]
```
<br>
### Conditional Statements
Conditional statements can decide which code you want to execute using the "if", "elseif", "else", "then" and "end" key words. The "then" keyword will signify the end of a comparison statement. "end" will be the end of the conditional block.
```lua
local c = 100
if c > 100 then
  print("greater than") --this is not executed
end

if c > 100 then
  print("over 100")
elseif c < 50 then
  print("less than 50")
else
  print("reached me")
end

--result: reached me
```
<br>
Check if a value is defined:
```lua
local x
if x == nil then
  print("here")
end
--result: here
```

<br>
Comparison symbols:
* == equality
* < less than
* \> greater than
* <= less than or equal to
* \>= greater than or equal to
* ~= inequality

You can also invert the value of a condition using the keyword "not"
```lua
let x = 10
if not x == 10 then
  print("here")
end
--result:
```

Combining statements using "or" and "and"
```lua
local x = 10
if x == 10 and x < 0 then
  print("both statements are true")
elseif x == 100 or x < 0 then
  print("at least one statement is true")
end
--result: at least one statement is true
```
<br>
### Loops
* while
* for
* foreach

<br>
### Scope

<br>
### Functions

<br>
### Table Manipulation
* insert
* remove
* looping
* sort

<br>
### Math
The math class has a number of functions for dealing with numbers. You may not need them but here is some of the more useful one functions:
* abs
* ceil
* deg
* exp
* floor
* pi
* rad
* random
* sqrt
* tointeger
* type

### Game State

<br>
### KV Files

<br>
### Lua Abilities

<br>
#### Event Listeners:
* OnSpellStart()
  * When cast time ends, resources have been spent


* OnAbilityPhaseStart()
  * When cast time begins, resources have not been spent. Return true for successful cast, or false for unsuccessful.


* OnAbilityPhaseInterrupted()
  * When cast time is cancelled for any reason.


* OnProjectileThink( vLocation )
  * Thinker function for projectile(s) created by this ability
  * vLocation is the current projectile location.


* OnProjectileHit( hTarget, vLocation )
  * A projectile has travelled its max distance or collided with a unit
  * if hTarget is nil, it means the projectile has expired.
  * If the projectile has reached its end, it will expire even if false is passed
  * return true to destroy the particle, return false to continue the projectile ( this applies for linear projectiles that can hit multiple NPCs, like Dragon Slave.


* GetIntrinsicModifierName()
  * Return "modifier_name" of the modifier that is passively added by this ability.


* OnChannelFinish( bInterrupted )
  * When channel finishes
  * bInterrupted parameter notifies if the channel finished or not.


* OnUpgrade()
  * When the ability is leveled up.

<br>
#### Casting Behavior:
* GetBehavior()
  * Determines the type of targeting behavior used with the cursor, return expects value from DOTA_ABILITY_BEHAVIOR enum ( i.e. DOTA_ABILITY_BEHAVIOR_UNIT_TARGET, DOTA_ABILITY_BEHAVIOR_POINT )


* GetCooldown( nLevel )
  * Determines the cooldown started when the spell is cast. Return float value.


* GetCastRange( vLocation, hTarget )
  * Determines the cast range. Return integer value.


* GetChannelTime()
  * Determines the channel time. Return float value.
